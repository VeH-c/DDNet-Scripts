# echo Fire Spam! (enable for lots of (local)chat spam...)


+fire


##### Information #####

# fire spam script, very usefull with Hammer! but must be bound to the keyboard, the mouse will only execute scripts once,
# if another keyboard key is press it will quit/stop the execution of this action, 
# so one can hold left & spam fire but not spam fire & then run left (why still spaming fire).

# this is a note, it will not execute. use: exec "Fire Spam.cfg"  with quotes to execute this script.
